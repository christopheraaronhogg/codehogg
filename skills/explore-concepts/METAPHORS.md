# Physical Metaphor Vocabulary

A reference of physical and material language for describing UI directions. Use these to create evocative, IP-safe style descriptions.

## Why Physical Metaphors?

Instead of referencing existing designs ("Stripe-like", "Apple-inspired"), describe the **physicality** of the interface:

| Avoid (IP Issues) | Use Instead (Physical) |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| "Stripe dashboard" | "Glass panel command center" |
| "Apple minimalism" | "Breathing white space gallery" |
| "Brutalist web" | "Raw concrete block architecture" |
| "Glassmorphism" | "Frosted acrylic layering" |
