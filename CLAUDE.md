## Vision-Driven Development

This project uses WTV for vision-driven AI development.

### Vision Context
- Read `VISION.md` from project root for core project vision
- Read all markdown files in `vision/` directory for additional context (roadmap, values, ideas)
- If no vision exists, suggest running `wtv init` to create one

### Agent System
- Expert agents are defined in the tool's agents directory
- Read `AGENTS.md` for agent coordination rules
