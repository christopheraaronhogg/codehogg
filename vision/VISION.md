# Vision

> "And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it."
> — Habakkuk 2:2 (KJV)

## Purpose
This system is for everyone who believes they have a clear vision for a project, or a feature, and they want it implemented by a mixture of ai agents, each specialized in important disciplines in the software development lifecycle.

## Outcomes
WTV would be successful if it built an easy-to-use, approachable, well rounded system for coordinating ai agents to execute on the vision the user discloses.

## Values
We want it to be fast, easy to install, intuitive to use, and not bloated. we want just the right system dropped into the users repo. we want to help users record the vision, and make it plain, so that who or whatever reads it (agents) can execute.

## Constraints
<!-- What's off-limits? Time, budget, compliance, dependencies? -->

## Stage
MVP

## Current Focus
Shipping. making it easily accessable on any device that can run `npx writethevision`.
