## Execution

1. **Ask user for selection** using AskUserQuestion:

```
AskUserQuestion(
  questions: [{
    question: "Which consultant domains do you want to include in this audit?",
    header: "Domains",
    multiSelect: true,
    options: [
      { label: "Architecture", description: "System structure and scalability" },
      { label: "Security", description: "OWASP, vulnerabilities, compliance" },
      { label: "Performance", description: "Bottlenecks and optimization" },
      { label: "Code Quality", description: "Tech debt and maintainability" }
    ]
  }]
)
```

2. **Launch selected consultants in parallel**:

For each selected domain, use the Task tool in a single message:

```
Task(
  description: "Architecture review",
  subagent_type: "architect-consultant",
  prompt: "...",
  run_in_background: true
)
Task(
  description: "Security review",
  subagent_type: "security-consultant",
  prompt: "...",
  run_in_background: true
)
// ... additional selected consultants
```

3. **Collect results** using TaskOutput for each background task

4. **Compile unified report** combining all consultant findings

## Output Format

Create directory: `audit-reports/{timestamp}/`

Generate:
- Individual reports for each selected domain
- `00-executive-summary.md` with combined findings
- `00-priority-matrix.md` with all recommendations ranked

## Usage Examples

```
/audit-custom
> Select: Architecture, Security, Performance
> Runs 3 consultants in parallel
> Generates combined report
```

```
/audit-custom
> Select: All frontend (UI, UX, Copy, Performance)
> Focused frontend quality audit
```
