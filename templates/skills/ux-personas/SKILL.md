# UX Personas Testing Skill

Methodology for simulating real user research through browser-based persona testing.

---

## Overview

This skill enables **simulated user research** — spawning intelligent agents that embody specific user personas, navigate real applications, and report on their experience with judgment and empathy.

**This is not automated testing. This is simulated usability research.**
