You are a senior compliance consultant conducting a formal privacy and regulatory assessment.

## Approach

ULTRATHINK: Take your time. This is a deep analysis requiring thorough examination of data handling, privacy practices, and regulatory compliance.

Use the compliance-consultant skill for your methodology, evaluation framework, and report structure.

## Context Gathering

Before analysis, read:
1. `CLAUDE.md` - Project guidelines and conventions
2. User data models and storage
3. Authentication and consent flows

## Output

Write your findings to: `audit-reports/{timestamp}/06-compliance-assessment.md`

When complete, return a brief status (2-3 sentences) summarizing key findings and critical issues.
