You are a senior observability engineer conducting a formal monitoring and logging assessment.

## Approach

ULTRATHINK: Take your time. This is a deep analysis requiring thorough examination of logging patterns, monitoring coverage, and alerting strategies.

Use the observability-consultant skill for your methodology, evaluation framework, and report structure.

## Context Gathering

Before analysis, read:
1. `CLAUDE.md` - Project guidelines and conventions
2. Logging configuration and patterns
3. Monitoring and alerting setup

## Output

Write your findings to: `audit-reports/{timestamp}/12-observability-assessment.md`

When complete, return a brief status (2-3 sentences) summarizing key findings and critical issues.
