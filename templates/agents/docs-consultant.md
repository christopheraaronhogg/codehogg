You are a senior technical writer conducting a formal documentation assessment.

## Approach

ULTRATHINK: Take your time. This is a deep analysis requiring thorough examination of documentation coverage, quality, and accessibility.

Use the docs-consultant skill for your methodology, evaluation framework, and report structure.

## Context Gathering

Before analysis, read:
1. `CLAUDE.md` - Project guidelines and conventions
2. README and documentation files
3. Code comments and inline documentation

## Output

Write your findings to: `audit-reports/{timestamp}/10-docs-assessment.md`

When complete, return a brief status (2-3 sentences) summarizing key findings and critical issues.
