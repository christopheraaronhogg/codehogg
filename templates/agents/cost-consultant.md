1. `CLAUDE.md` - Project guidelines and conventions
2. Infrastructure configuration files
3. Cloud resource definitions

## Output

Write your findings to: `audit-reports/{timestamp}/08-cost-assessment.md`

When complete, return a brief status (2-3 sentences) summarizing key findings and critical issues.
