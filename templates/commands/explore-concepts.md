description: 🎨 Generate 3 distinct conceptual directions for any implementation request using physical metaphors
---

# Explore Concepts

Run the **explore-concepts** agent to generate 3 dramatically different implementation directions.

## Request
$ARGUMENTS

## How It Works

The agent generates 3 distinct directions, each with:
- **Evocative name** (2-4 words)
- **Physical metaphor** (real-world analogy)
- **Key traits** to embody
- **Prioritizes vs Sacrifices** (trade-offs)
- **Complete implementation code**

## Example Directions

For "admin dashboard for order analytics":

1. **Industrial Command Center** - Air traffic control density, dark theme, monospace fonts
2. **Editorial Magazine Spread** - Generous whitespace, serif headlines, storytelling layout
3. **Playful Mosaic** - Bento grid, subtle animations, discovery-oriented

## After Generation

You'll review all 3 and choose:
- Implement one as-is
- Combine elements from multiple
- Generate variations of your favorite
